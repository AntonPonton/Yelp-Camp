A full stack application â€“ built during Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course.

## About

This project was built as part of the Colt Steel's Udemy course. Fake-Camp is an app that lists fictional campgrounds, with full CRUD (crate, read, update, delete) functionality implemented for Users, Campgrounds, and Reviews.

The fun part was also to redesign the layout and implement some additional features.

## Features

- Login, Register, Admin role
- RESTful routes (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for campgrounds and reviews
- Create routes have authentication
- Update and Delete routes have authentication and authorization
- Mapbox API
- Search function (by location or name)
- Sort function (by rate or price)
- Filter feature (by tag)
- Average rating for campgrounds
- Timestamp for reviews and campgrounds

## Methodology

- Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern - architecture of the app.
- Node.js + Express - backend framework for RESTful routes.
- Embedded Javascript Templates (EJS) - for dynamic HTML templating.
- MongoDB Atlas - cloud-based NoSQL database.
- Bootstrap 5 - CSS framework for styling.
- PassportJs - for the authentication and authorization.
- Cloudinary - could database to store images.
- Heroku - as the cloud hosting provider

## Graphic content

I decided to populate the app with fake data in order to enhance the look. For all the graphical content I used Midjourney - AI-powered tool that can produce images based on the text input.
